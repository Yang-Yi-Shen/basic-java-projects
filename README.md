# Basic Java projects

I'm learning Java for the AP Computer Science A exam in May 2024, so I thought that I'd do some simple Java projects to make sure that my skills were adequate. If you're learning Java and doing projects as well, feel free to share them with me! I'd love to compare code with my peers and see how I'm doing.

The project ideas come from [this page](https://bootcamp.cvn.columbia.edu/blog/java-projects-for-beginners-to-gain-skills/). I am studying the language using James Gosling's "The Java Programming Language", Fourth Edition.
